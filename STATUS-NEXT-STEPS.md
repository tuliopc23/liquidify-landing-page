# Project Status and Next Steps — 2025-09-14

Scope
- Repo: liquidify-landing-page (marketing + showcase)
- Stack: React 19, Vite 7, Panda CSS, TanStack Router (file-based via plugin), Bun

Where we left off (today)
1) Routing and dev/build flow
- Using Vite for dev/build/preview.
- TanStack Router with file-based routes enabled (routeTree.gen.ts generated by the plugin).
- Root layout at src/routes/__root.tsx loads global CSS in the correct order (Panda → liquidify-react), renders Navbar → Outlet → Footer, and wraps the app with HelmetProvider.

2) Showcase (/components) — rendering, UX, and reliability
- Grid renders cards from a registry (src/showcase/GridParts.tsx) and shows a count: “Found N components”.
- Previews lazy-load via import.meta.glob and hydrate when visible.
- Added fallbacks to ensure previews render:
  - IntersectionObserver fallback: if IO is unavailable or the card is already in/near viewport on mount, preview renders immediately.
  - ErrorBoundary per card to avoid a single failure breaking the grid.
- Added a “Show code” toggle per card to display the preview’s raw source.
- Expanded previews (under src/previews/): Button, Checkbox, Tabs, Dialog, Popover, Tooltip, Switch, Progress. Registry updated accordingly.
- All preview imports are from the library root (import { … } from "liquidify-react") to match the installed package’s exports.

3) SEO and metadata
- Route-level head tags via react-helmet-async for / and /components (title, description, canonical, basic OG/Twitter).
- JSON-LD ItemList for /components.
- Added public/robots.txt and public/sitemap.xml.

4) Fonts (CDN)
- Replaced unreliable SF Pro CDN links with Google Fonts Inter and a robust fallback stack including system fonts and SF Pro (if present locally).
- index.html now preconnects to Google Fonts and uses Inter variable font. Body font-family is a stable stack.

5) Build status
- Typecheck and production build pass via Vite.
- Local preview runs (vite preview).

Known issues (observed/likely)
- If cards or previews don’t render on /components:
  - Check the visible count first (should be > 0).
  - Open browser console for runtime errors (import/export issues, missing chunk, etc.).
  - IO fallback and ErrorBoundary reduce failure modes; if you still see no previews, it’s likely a specific import or runtime error we can fix quickly.
- SEO images (og:image, twitter:image) point to placeholders; we should add the final asset(s) and absolute URLs.

How to run
- Dev: bun run dev → http://localhost:5173/
- Build: bun run build
- Preview: bun run preview → http://localhost:4173/

Next steps (ordered)
1) Verify showcase rendering in your environment
- Open /components and confirm you see: heading, search, “Found N components”, and cards. If previews still fail to render, capture the first console error and we’ll fix it immediately.

2) Expand the preview registry to ~12–16 components
- Add: Select, Combobox, Slider, RatingGroup, Menu, NumberInput, TagsInput, Toast.
- Keep previews small, SSR-safe, and import from liquidify-react (root export).

3) Add code highlighting to “Show code”
- Integrate Prism client-side for the preview source block (no extra build tooling).

4) SEO polish
- Supply real og:image and twitter:image assets; use absolute canonical/OG URLs.
- Add JSON-LD SoftwareApplication on the home page with basic metadata (name, description, URL).

5) Optional: SSR toggle when/if grid grows heavy
- If we see TTFB/SEO needs, flip scripts to TanStack Start SSR (adapter-less via Nitro) with server.preset: 'vercel' in start.config.ts. No app code rewrite required.

6) After content stabilizes: CI and budgets
- Add banned-words grep (storybook|tailwind), lint, typecheck, build, and optional size budgets for showcase and key JS chunks.

Files touched today (high level)
- Routing/structure: src/routes/__root.tsx, src/routes/index.tsx, src/routes/components.tsx, src/main.tsx
- Showcase: src/showcase/GridParts.tsx, src/previews/*.tsx (8 previews)
- Fonts/SEO: index.html, public/robots.txt, public/sitemap.xml
- Config: package.json (scripts/deps kept modern), TanStack Router plugin already configured

Notes
- We kept the toolchain simple (Vite + TanStack Router). The code is SSR-friendly to enable a quick Start/Nitro switch later if needed.
- Avoided any banned tools; Panda/styled-system stays the CSS system.
