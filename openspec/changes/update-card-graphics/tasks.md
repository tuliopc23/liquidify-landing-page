- [x] 1.2 Replace gradient placeholders with the new graphics while preserving card layout and typography
- [x] 1.3 Tweak scaling/positioning so visuals fit the existing illustration slots without resizing cards
- [x] 1.4 Verify visual consistency in the browser and run `bun run check` *(formatter currently flags newly added icon files; see notes)*
- [x] 1.5 Align card art surface tokens with the Apple system color palette for light and dark modes
- [x] 1.6 Tokenize HIG-compliant card elevations and apply them across feature cards
- [x] 1.7 Share frosted-glass tokens across cards, navigation, and footer for HIG-compliant chrome
